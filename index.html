    <h3>Achievements</h3>
    <p>I have completed both an unreal engine course on Udemy, and taught myself how to use the Unity engine. This led me to learn both C# and C++ both.
        Now, I am currently taking a full-stack course on Udemy as well, learning slowly but steadily about WebDev. I also associate myself with robotics.
        My 8th grade year my team qualified for worlds and state. We won our schools very first excellence award at state and placed very well at worlds. 
        This year I will be trying for main coder and deciding to program our bot for my team.
